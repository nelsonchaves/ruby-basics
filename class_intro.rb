Intro to Classes
- So classes, are simply blueprints or templates for creating objects.
- The goal of object-oriented design is to use code to model real-life things as classes
- An object is a custom container for data. It is made from a class.
- object group functionalities into a single unit
- You don't want to design 10 different methods, that 10 different things that a user can do without having some kind of container for it.
- A user can sleep, they can drive, they can eat, they can read.
- And all those things correspond to that user.

- Instance variable - variables that belong to that specific object.

- Attributes - provide information about the objects current state.
So imagine somebody comes to you with a book and says to you, what is this book's current state?
- You might say, well, this book is ripped up and it's three years old.

- So what attributes are is descriptive details or characteristics or properties about the object.
An attribute is a detail about it.
- It's a characteristic.
- It's something that the scribes that write the book has this number of pages.
- It has this author.
- It has this publisher.
- It's just a piece of information about the object.

Instance methods - objects also have instance methods and instance methods are things that actually send messages to the object that interact with it.
- They also belong to the object.

- This all ties into a concept called encapsulation and encapsulation means that an object generally tries to restrict access to its data and prevent it from being manipulated without a specific message.

- So encapsulation is the idea that we want to restrict direct access to an object and only allow interaction with it in the way that we'd like to have it in the secure way that we define.
