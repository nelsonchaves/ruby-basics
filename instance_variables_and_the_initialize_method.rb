=begin
- The initialize method is called immediately when an object is instantiated from a class with the new method.
- The initialize method offers an opportunity to assign values to instance variables in order to define the object’s state
- if the initialize method is not defined in the class, each object is initiated with no state
- The assignment of values to instance variables does not mean the values have to stay constant. The object’s state can be altered later
